# Onion-Pi


An attempt of Adafruit's Onion Pi [Tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/overview) on Raspberry Pi 2. Once installed correctly, it can be hooked on a router's LAN port to route all client traffic to Tor.

This solution attempts to solve some issues on the tutorial (the RPi starts to route traffic back to normal on reboot) and resolving RPi 2 compatibility issues with RTL8192EU Wireless Adapters.
